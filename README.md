# Index_Rebalancing_Strat
## **Concept:**

Throughout the year, indexes add, remove and update stocks within their holdings. These events are
well-telegraphed and the rules for some indexes are quantitative and thus the changes predictable.
These events create liquidity situations where traders can help offset the short-term needs of index
tracking portfolios (private, ETPs, etc.).

## **Objective:**

Analyze the data provided of all index events that have occurred since May 2022. Identify and backtest
potential trading opportunities. The goal of this exercise is to analyze your thought process and
technical skills when attempting to build a strategy.

## Dataset:

corporate actions or index criteria requirements. The dataset includes additions, deletions, and weight
changes for the following indices:

• S&P 400 / 500 / 600

• MSCI

• Russell 1000 / 2000 / 3000

• NASDAQ 100

• Additional EOD ticker price data from yfinance to be added
